# Five Die

###The simple, yet surprisingly addictive, dice game.

##Description:
This version of Five Die is a 1 player game of chance and light strategy.
A player starts with 5 dice and rolls them to get the lowest possible score.
It is also my first ever game programmed completely with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

##Rules:
1.	You want to get the LOWEST possible score
2.	You MUST select at least 1 die per roll (yes, you may select > 1 die too)
3. 	1=1pts, 2=2pts, 3=0pts, 4=4pts, 5=5pts, 6=6pts

##Strategy:
Roll and claim as many 3's as you can.  The lowest possible score is 0 and for the hackers out there the lower limit is infinite ;)  It's already been hacked by my instructors.

##How to Play:
